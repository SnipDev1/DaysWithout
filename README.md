# Days Without

### Purpose:
I wanted to track some of the actions performed or words said by me or my friends, so this small app can help you with this.

### How to use:
You need to execute `"python main.py"`, then you'll see empty table. 

To add _event_ type in `add`, then input event name and event description using `,` as separator.

To see events table just type in `events`

When this event happens you need to type in `reset` and then it's id.

It is enough to use it, but also you can delete, edit, and see timestamps of event - just type `help` to see how you can do this.

### For devs
I've added some QoL features for you. Just see how operations, which is already implemented, are created and use the same methods, my way is pretty comfy.

### ToDo
1. [ ] User should be able to change visibility of `Days Without | Hours Without | Minutes Without | Seconds Without`, maybe add settings menu for future needs
### P. S.
It is really niche program and I understand this. But if you need it, use it ;)
